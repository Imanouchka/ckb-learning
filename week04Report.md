## What I Learned

- Understood the basic structure of a project.
- Learned about high-level functions and syscalls, and why Rust is often preferred over C in this context.

## Challenges I Faced

- Initially installed the wrong version of Capsule (v0.10 instead of the required v0.9), which caused  issues.
