#  Week 09 Report – SENNARIA IMANE  
**November 10–16, 2025**

##  What I Did
- Worked with **OFFCKB** using **JavaScript**.
- Repeated the same workflow as Week 08, but implemented fully in JavaScript:
  - Built the smart contract  
  - Deployed it  
  - Tested it  

## 📚 What I Learned
- Learned the basics of **JavaScript**, since I started using it this week.
- Revisited the entire process (build → deploy → test) using JavaScript.
- Gained a clearer understanding of how the **off-chain workflow** works with OFFCKB.

## ⚠️ Challenges I Faced
- **Error:** I forgot to run the node, which caused the tests to fail.

## 📂 Important Files

- [`Test1.mock.test.js`](./Test1.mock.test.js)

## 🧪 Results

Tests ran successfully:

This was a **basic example**, similar to Week 08, but the main purpose was to redo the workflow using **JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Goals for Next Week
- Continue learning **JavaScript basics**.
- Build and test a **new smart contract** and its **off-chain code (CCC)**.
- Start working on a more **complex contract**.
