# Week 03 Report – SENNARIA Imane –July 7-13, 2025

## What I Did

- Followed a YouTube video series explaining Rust programming.
-  Progressed through the LA Developer Toolkit — reached the last lesson "Creating a Token".
- Completed LAB1 to LAB5 (excluding any involving Lumos) without checking the provided solutions.


### LAB1 (Convert IC3Type to OC5Type) Execution Output

### LAB2 (Convert DataCap to DataRange) Execution Output

### LAB3 (Convert the Counter to a Double Counter) Execution Output

### LAB4 (Convert the Double Counter to an Aggregatable Double Counter) Execution Output

### LAB5 (Add Operation Detection to the Double Counter) Execution Output

## What I Learned

- Understood the basic structure of a project.
- Learned about high-level functions and syscalls, and why Rust is often preferred over C in this context.
- Understood why grouping cells (group input and group output) is more efficient for transaction logic, and how using `QueryIter` to iterate through existing cells simplifies the process.
- Improved my understanding of numerical conversions (e.g., Base64, Base128) through labs.
- Gained a better grasp of ownership concepts in Rust by working through hands-on examples.
- Built experience in handling and troubleshooting errors while testing capsules.

## Challenges I Faced

- Initially installed the wrong version of Capsule (v0.10 instead of the required v0.9), which caused  issues.

-Struggled to understand binary representation and numeric literals in Rust (e.g., `8u64`, `0u128`) — especially how data types and bit widths affect behavior.

![Lab5 Error](./LAb5-Error.png)
- Learning Rust is challenging, as it is closer to the machine and introduces unique concepts like ownership — concepts not present in the languages I’m more familiar with.


## Gols for Next Week

- Completed the Rust programming video series on YouTube.
- Advance further in the Rust course on Amine's Udemy account — aim to reach 50% or more.
- Construct and successfully send my **first custom CKB transaction** from scratch.
